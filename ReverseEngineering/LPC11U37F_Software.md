# LPC11U37F/501 Software

The purpose of this document is to track information regarding the software that
 runs on the LPC11U37F main/master processor of the controller. The LPC11U37F 
 is a 32-bit processor ARMv6-M architecture with 16-bit Thumb ISA and includes 
 Thumb-2 technology.

## Firmware primer

The LPC11U37F binary is split into two parts: The first 0x2000 bytes contain
the bootloader, while the rest contains the firmware. You can find the version
of each component in Steam's controller "Support" screen, next to "bootloader
revision" and "firmware revision".

The bootloader's job is simple: If the firmware at 0x2000 looks correct (has the
right magic at offset 0x30) and GPREG1 of the CPU isn't set to a magic value,
the bootloader will simply jump to the firmware's entrypoint. However, if the
firmware doesn't have the right magic or GPREG1 has a magic value, the
bootloader will enter programming mode, exposing a HID device that the Steam
desktop software can communicate with to flash a new firmware.

The firmware's job is basically everything else, from playing the starting
jingle to getting button input and turning them into a HID stream to send over
USB/to the nRF chip.


# Reverse Engineering Artifacts

This section details the results of the reverse engineering effort. These are 
 the final references that contain data which is the basis for other Subprojects.

Now that the artifacts below pertain to the vcf_wired_controller_d0g_57bf5c10.bin
 firmware provided by Valve.

## vcf_wired_controller_d0g_57bf5c10.c

This file contains data on how the simulation has shown the controller to behave
 in different scenarios. The idea is to capture and identify as many actions
 as possible (with a focus on finding recurring code and memory usage) so that
 controller behavior can be understood to the extent and completely custom
 firmware can be created. 

## vcf_wired_controller_d0g_57bf5c10.h

This file tracks unique functions called in vcf_wired_controller_d0g_57bf5c10.c
 and attempts to document each function as best as possible.

## vcf_wired_controller_d0g_57bf5c10.mem

The file tracks memory usage and attempts to identify how different section of 
 memory are used by the firmware. 

## vcf_wired_controller_d0g_57bf5c10.bootloader.gzf

This file is a complete reverse engineering of the bootloader section of the
binary, using [Ghidra].

# Disassembling the Firmware

This section details the approaches attempted and ultimately used to reverse 
 engineer the Steam Controller firmware running on the LPC11U37.

## [pinkySim](https://github.com/greggersaurus/pinkySim)

This is the primary method used for simulating the firmware and deconstructing 
 its behavior.

* Note: Need to build pinkySim specifically with command "make pinkySim" as building unit tests fails...
    * TODO: get to bottom of this.
* Note: cloning is also messy for me. See updated README for details how I needed to do this on my dev system...
    * TODO: get to bottom of this.
* ARMv6-M Thumb instruction simulator.
* I have forked this repo and am working on custom functionality geared specfically towards the Steam Controller reverse engineering effort.
    * Logging (--logExe chipType)
        * Creates csv log of all instructions and memory accesses executed during simulation.
        * Creates C log of actions, which allows secondary way of visualizing simulation.
        * Currently "LPC11U37" is the only supported chip type
    * Disassembly
        * TODO: Worth spending time on option to out asm after running simulation? (will only cover instructions that were executed during sim)
* Using gdb installed by LPCXpresso IDE (On OSX: /Applications/lpcxpresso_8.2.2_650/lpcxpresso/tools/bin/arm-none-eabi-gdb) to connect to the simulator

### Simulation Steps

#### Launch Simulator 

The following command launches the emulator with the proper memory map for the 
 LPC11U37F501, has the emulator halt on the first instruction to execute after
 reset and instructs pinkySim to log all instructions executed to a file named
 exeLog{timestmap}.csv. exeLog{timestmap}.c is also created, which makes a simple
 attempt at a C-like decomposition of the simulated actions. 

* ./pinkySim --breakOnStart --logExe LPC11U37 --flash 0 131072 --ram 268435456 8192 --ram 536805376 16384 --ram 536870912 2048 --ram 536887296 2048 --ram 1073741824 16384 --ram 1073758208 16384 --ram 1073774592 16384 --ram 1073790976 16384 --ram 1073807360 16384 --ram 1073823744 16384 --ram 1073840128 16384 --ram 1073856512 16384 --ram 1073971200 16384 --ram 1073987584 16384 --ram 1074003968 16384 --ram 1074020352 16384 --ram 1074036736 16384 --ram 1074053120 16384 --ram 1074102272 16384 --ram 1074118656 16384 --ram 1074135040 16384 --ram 1074266112 16384 --ram 1342177280 16484 --ram 3758096384 1048576 firmware.bin
    * Note: --ram 536805376 16384 --flash, but since we need to fill this ROM with the boot ROM code via gdb, this needs to be writable

#### Simulate

The following command launches gbd (installed by LPCXpresso IDE on OSX at /Applications/lpcxpresso_8.2.2_650/lpcxpresso/tools/bin/arm-none-eabi-gdb) and executes the commands in gdbCmdFile:

* ./gdb -ex "source gdbCustomCmds" -ex "source gdbCmdFile"
    * See comments in [gdbCustomCmds](./gdbCustomCmds) for details on gdb user-defined commands to simulate through certain function calls.
    * See comments in [gdbCmdFile](./gdbCmdFile) for details on simulation is doing, and can be configured to do.
    * A binary file named LPC11U3x16kBbootROM.bin is expected to exist (in the current directory). The file should contain the binary dump of 0x1FFF0000 to 0x1FFF4000 from an LPC11U37.
        * This can be obtained from a Steam Controller using custom firmware from the [Development Board](../DevBoard) project. Use read commands to peek at the 16 kB boot ROM.

### Simulation Details

This section details different paths from which we may want to simulate the firmware.

[vcf_wired_controller_d0g_57bf5c10.c](./vcf_wired_controller_d0g_57bf5c10.c) is an attempt to turn the simulation results
 into C code with, at least some of, the same functionality as the vcf_wired_controller_d0g_57bf5c10.bin firmware.

#### Initialization

By default, simulation starts at instruction specified via Vector Table RESET entry point.
 
Simulation is allowed to run with minimal intervention (i.e. loops waiting for
 PLLs to lock or other hardware reactions are simulated as needed, pauses are
 made to adjust values "read" from EEPROM). 

Unknown paths are identified to be revisited lated with further stimuli to
 simulation runs. These are being marked by TODO: UNKOWN PATHS.

Attempts are made being made to identify SRAM0 memory usage.

#### Exceptions 

This section details attempts to simulate certain exception paths. This is being 
 pursued as Reset/Init path eventually called WFI instruction. This implies
 interrupts occurring is a necessary part of system boot (i.e. either successful
 connection or shutdown due to connection timeout).

Simulating an exception can be achieved by setting the PC register to the 
 instruction specified in the Vector Table. However, keep in mind the nuances
 of how IRQ actually work and that simply setting the PC will allow you to 
 simulate the interrupt accurately, but may be desctructive in terms of picking 
 back up where the main thread code was interrupted. 

According to 24.3.3.6.1 xPSR, PC, LR, R12, R3, R2, R1 and R0 are saved upon
 interrupt and restored upon exit. Save and restore these values if you want to
 pick up the main thread after simulating an interrupt.

Also, according 24.3.3.6.1 LR is set to EXC_RETURN upon interrupt entry. Thus a
 bx to LR (assuming no further stack pushes (without matching pops) to change 
 LR), will indicate an interrupt exit. In short, set LR to a know instruction 
 (maybe a WFI instruction or something that will cause an emulator break) before
 changing the PC to the interrupt handler so that you know when the interrupt 
 handler is exiting.

## [FirmwareParser.py](./FirmwareParser.py)

This is only being used to display the Vector Table.

The original idea was to create disassembler that can recreate assembly file, 
distinguishing data versus instructions by evaluating code and all possible
branches. 

In the end this was a larger undertaking than expected. It would make more 
sense to leverage pinkySim's ability to decode instructions and their 
behavior to do this, as opposed to starting from scratch.

## [Reverse Engineering for Beginners](https://github.com/dennis714/RE-for-beginners)

Have not made much use of this yet. 

Free book geared towards beginners on how to reverse engineer code.

## [Radare](http://www.radare.org/r/)

This may be worth learning and using as a supplementary tool (now that time spent
 with pinkySim has give me better understanding of assembly flow). 

Somewhat different approach than pinkySim in that we are looking at assembly and trying 
 to assess actions that could be taken and potential purpose, as opposed to focusing on
 actions taken during simulation and why they were taken (and maybe should not have been).

## [Fracture](https://github.com/draperlaboratory/fracture)

This proved to not be particularly useful for raw stripped binary.

* Decompiles to LLVM intermediate representation
    * It looks like this does not work with binary file format with no code/data sections information.
    * Simulation with pinkySim can be utilized to possibly rebuild this section information and then revisit this tool?

## LPCXpresso

This proved to not be particularly useful for raw stripped binary.

* Disassemble axf https://community.nxp.com/thread/388997.
    * It looks like this does not work with binary file format with no code/data sections information.

## [Online Disassembler](https://onlinedisassembler.com/odaweb/)

This proved to not be particularly useful for raw stripped binary.

* Good source to punch individual instruction in quickly
* Make minor mods to instructions to verify understanding of how they are being decoded and behaving (i.e. LDR)
* Finicky interface
    * Might work better if file is uploaded instead of copy paste
* Without code/data section information tool tries to decode everything
    * Simulation with pinkySim can be utilized to possibly rebuild this section information and then revisit this tool?

## [objdump](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/binutils/objdump.html)

This proved to not be particularly useful for raw stripped binary.

* ./arm-none-eabi-objdump -b binary -D vcf_wired_controller_d0g_57bf5c10.bin -m arm attempts to disassemble binary file
* With have firmware binary format (i.e. no code/data sections information) this only helps so much. 
    * Simulation with pinkySim can be utilized to possibly rebuild this section information and then revisit this tool?

## [ARMu](http://pel.hu/armu/)

Have not need to look into this much yet.

* For ARMv5TE, but might be worth understanding approach if this works from binary

## [Capstone](http://www.capstone-engine.org/)

Have not need to look into this much yet.

* Worth looking into?
